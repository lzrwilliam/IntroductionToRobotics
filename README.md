**Welcome to the my "Introduction to Robotics (2023-2024)" repository.**

As a passionate 21-year-old student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in Bucharest and currently in the third year, I have embarked on a journey into the fascinating world of robotics. This repository serves as a storage for various projects, documentation, code implementations, and technical specifications that I've developed during my coursework.

***About Me***

I am passionated about Computer Science, especially about networking and now day by day, about robotics.  While I may not be the most enthusiastic person , I've come to appreciate the intricacies and possibilities of this domain.
This repository is a collection of projects and coursework completed during my introduction to robotics. It is a way to share my learning experience and to manage it in a productive way.


***Expectation of things to be found here***

The current repository will contain all of my work during this semester during the "Introduction to Robotics" laboratory. It will contain detailed instructions such as images, explanations of the code implementations, video recordings and technical drawings.

**Homework 2**

This homework consists in having an RGB(Red-Green-Blue) Led controlled by 3 potentiometers, combining the intensity of each colour in order to obtain any possible colour. For controlling the intensity of each colour of the led, we use a separate potentiometer, so we will have 3 in total, along with 3 resistors for each channel.
